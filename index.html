    <p>Lacrosse, which originated as the "Medicine Game", amongst its creators, the Native Americans, has grown exponentially throughout the world.<br> 
        The Native Americans used this game, beginning around the 12th Century, for ritualistic and war training purposes. There are individuals or <br> 
        stickmakers who specialize in the art of shaping lacrosse sticks in the ancient methods, by carving hickory, string to craft the net, products of <br> 
        animals and leather straps. Today, the game is enjoyed around the world, from youth (k-12), college, and professional atmospheres.</p>
